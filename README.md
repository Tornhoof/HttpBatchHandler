# HttpBatchHandler
HttpBatchHandler for  ASP .NET Core 3.0

## Currently working
- Customization of batch handler by OnXXXEvents
- HttpContent for batch requests (the old WebAPI 2.0 libraries should not be necessary anymore)

## TODO
- Edge case error handling
- The library should be probably split into two parts, one for the requests and one for the actual batchhandler
